In the file install.yml, you can modify your installation by comment or supress the line you don't need (prerequisites.yml, prometheus_install.yml and grafana_install.yml must be install).
~~~ shell
- hosts: local 
  name: Installing monitoring server 
  tasks: 
    - include: prerequisites.yml 
    - include: node_exporter_install.yml 
#    - include: node_exporter_service_install.yml 
    - include: sensors_install.yml 
#    - include: cadvisor_install.yml 
    - include: prometheus_install.yml 
    - include: grafana_install.yml 

- hosts: distant 
  name: Installing Distant Exporter 
  tasks: 
    - include: prerequisites.yml 
    - include: node_exporter_install.yml 
    - include: node_exporter_service_install.yml 
    - include: sensors_install.yml 
    - include: cadvisor_install.yml 

~~~
In 'conf' folder, you must change the prometheus configuration ("prometheus.yml") to monitor remote machine (change 'IpNode1' by an ip address that the monitoring server can contact, add more if you want).
~~~ shell
global:
 scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
 - job_name: prometheus
   static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9090']

 - job_name: node
   metrics_path: /metrics
   static_configs:
    - targets: ['192.168.1.9:9100','192.168.1.10:9100',...]
 
 - job_name: service
   metrics_path: /metrics
   static_configs:
    - targets: ['192.168.1.9:9110','192.168.1.10:9110',...]

 - job_name: cadvisor
   static_configs:
     - targets: ['192.168.1.9:8090','192.168.1.10:8090',...]
~~~

You can change too the grafana configuration ("grafana.ini")
